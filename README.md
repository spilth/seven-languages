# Seven Languages in Seven Weeks

This is my "homework" as I work through the book [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks).

## Running the Examples

You can execute the examples using Rake. To see a list of Rake tasks:

    rake -T

For example, to run Day 1 of the Ruby homework, use the following:

    rake ruby:day1
